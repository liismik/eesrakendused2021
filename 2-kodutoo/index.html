            This is a simple remake of the classic Snake game. 
            The goal is to eat as many of the red food as possible, thus increasing your score. 
            The game ends if you run into a wall or collide with yourself. 
            You can use both WASD and the arrow keys to guide your snake and it grows longer as you eat the food.
            If you lose, the game restarts itself and you can start over just by guiding the snake. Good luck.
